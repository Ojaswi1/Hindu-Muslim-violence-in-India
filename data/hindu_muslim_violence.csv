Bottles — soda water or was it acid? — were thrown at the procession.  On the same day, the Shiv Sena threatened to go in procession past all the important masjids in Poona.     On Mohammed’s birthday (April 16), acid bottles were thrown at a procession taken out to commemorate the event.  At the Shiv Jayanti  celebrations on May 4, provocative posters were put up by extremist Hindus, seevral of whom also made fiery communal speeches.     On May 6, a Muslim ex-wrestler cut off the thumb of the man who acted as Shivaji in a festival.  And, of course, the air was filed with rumours that there would be trouble during the bandh—particularly on May 15.  There were some stone-throwing incidents at a masjid.  The riots spread over several parts of Poona and continued unabated till May 18 though curfew had been imposed....     The Lal Nishan leader A. D. Bhosle attributed the riots basically to the traditional antagonism between the neo-Buddhist population and Muslim traders, the former being the customers of the latter in adjacent localities in Poona....     Paradoxically, the riots themselves centred around shop-keepers, often small ones.  Hindu provision sellers in a particular area supplied ample kerosene to the rioters, both before and during the riots, and it was mainly Muslim shops that were attacked.

As in 1975, so now it has tried  to stay away from the arena of conflict.  In fact, RSS volunteers were reportedly given specific directives five years ago nt to go anywhere near the trouble spots.  This time the leaders of the BJP, notably Mr. V. K. Malhotra and Mr. K. N. Sahani, have been keen on underlining that the majority of Muslims were not in favour f showing disrespect to the national flag unfurled in various localities by different leaders on independence day.  They have quoted two instances when the flags, fter being removed by some young Muslim ruffians, were retreived by elderly and responsible Muslims and returned to “their counterparts” in the majority community.  According to the two BJP leaders the whole trouble was fomented by a handful of goodnas protected by the Congress I leaders who had “earlier found these toughs useful during the elections.”” (M.
