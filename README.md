- **Welcome**
  - The report in this repo aims to explore the history of violent events between the 2 controversial religions of Hinduism and Islam in the context of post-independant India. Keeping in mind the recent riots in the capital New Delhi, it is essential to trace back and analyse this relationship in the latter half of the 20th century. This report relies on the dataset created by Varshney and Wilkinson, who collected all incidents on Hindu-Muslim Violence in India between 1950-1995 reported in the national newspaper Times of India.
